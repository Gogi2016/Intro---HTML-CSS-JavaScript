If there are issues in THML or CSS, browsers try its best to keep things working, making them their problrm solving meaning if there is a mistake, browser tries its best to make it function.

## Unit 2 Text-Formatting
HTML uses tages which are enclosed in less or greater than symbols to mark different elements. They are opening tags and closing tags <p> for opening and </p> for closing. These tags are both required, you can not use openning tag without closing it, vice vesa.

Tags that are as follows
Paragraph tag <p> <p/>,  When you write a paragraph you open the tag and when you have finished you close it. The paragraphs can be separated  whith the same tags.
Headline tags <h> </h>, Headlines come in six different types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. These tags are used in headlines, and in sub headlines. The element which is h1 is the largest, and h6 is the smallest.
Bold tags <strong></strong> and <b></b>, these tags <strong> make the text to be bold which shows importance. The <b> is the normal one and does not have any meaning but just simply allows developer to make text bold.
Italic <i></i> and emphasized <em></em>, <em> emphasises a taext that is typically displayes as italic. These 2 tags <em> amd <i> may be similar in appearance but have different meaning.
List tags <li></li> These tags are used to define a list that is ordered (<ol>) or unordered (<ul>

HTML Quotes
<cite>, <q> and <blockqoute>, These quotes are usually used in articles most of the times. <cite> is use to reference a source's qoute. 
<q> is commonly used to determine inline quotes and can be indicated by quotation marks in the browser.
<blockqoute> indicates that the text is no longer qouted from another source.

Date Element
<time> this element help us deals with both date and time in this tag it will show the users what you actually wrote between these tags. It allows us to write dates in a ways tha can be understood by people. There is also an attribute used which is datetime, which has a specific format like 2024-01-30 that tells the computer the exact date. e.g you can write January 30th between the <time> tags but we actually use (datetime) attricute like this <time datetime="2024-01-30">January 30, 2024</time >, This si what understoond by the computer.

HTML superscripts, subscripts and small text
