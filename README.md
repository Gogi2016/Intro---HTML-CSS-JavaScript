## Unit 2 Text-Formatting

HTML uses tages which are enclosed in less or greater than symbols to mark different elements. They are opening tags and closing tags <p> for opening and </p> for closing. These tags are both required, you can not use openning tag without closing it, vice vesa.

Tags that are as follows:  
Paragraph tag <p> <p/> When you write a paragraph you open this tag and when you have finished you close it. The paragraphs can be separated  whith the same tags.
Headline tags <h> </h> Headlines come in six different types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. These tags are used in headlines, and in sub headlines. The h1 element is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing
Bold tags <strong> </strong> and <b> </b> These tags <strong> make text to be bold, which is used to show importance, seriousness, or urgency. Then there is <b> element is more generic and neutral. It does not carry any specific meaning; it simply allows us to make something bold visually and does not imply any alternative voice or mood.
Italic tags <i> </i> and <em></em> : <em> represent emphasized text, typicallty displayed in italics. <i> displays in italic. These 2 tags may appear identical but carry different meaning.
List tags <li></li> : This is use to define a list within an ordered <ol> or unordered <ol> list

HTML Quotes
<cite> , <q> and <blockquote> <cite> is used to reference the source of a quote. on the otherside <blockquote> is used to indicate that the enclosed text is no longer quotated from another source. <q> is also use dto define inline quotation. It indicates that the enlosed text ia a quaotation and browser may tipically shows it with quotation mark.

Date Elements
The <time> element in HTML helps us deal with dates and times. It lets us write dates in a way that's easy for people to read on a webpage. But, it also has a special trick, the "datetime" attribute. This attribute uses a specific format like 2024-01-30 to tell computers the exact date.
For example, we might write "January 30th" between <time> tags, but behind the scenes, we use the "datetime" attribute like this: <time datetime="2024-01-30">January 30, 2024</time>. The computer understands the machine-readable version.
HTML Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text
Superscript is represented by <sup> </sup> tags. It is used for text that should be displayed above the normal text line, often for things like mathematical exponents.
Subscript is represented by <sub> </sub> tags. It is used for text that should be displayed below the normal text line, commonly used in chemical formulas or mathematical notation.
Small text is represented by <small> </small> tags. It is used to reduce the size of the text, typically for fine print or disclaimers.
