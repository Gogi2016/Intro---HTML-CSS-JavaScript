The web uses 3 main languages HTML for content, CSS for styles and Javascript tha adds interactions. If there are issues in THML or CSS, browsers try its best to keep things working, making them their problrm solving meaning if there is a mistake, browser tries its best to make it function.

## Unit 2 Text-Formatting
HTML uses tages which are enclosed in less or greater than symbols to mark different elements. They are opening tags and closing tags <p> for opening and </p> for closing. These tags are both required, you can not use openning tag without closing it, vice vesa.

Tags that are as follows
Paragraph tag <p> <p/>,  When you write a paragraph you open the tag and when you have finished you close it. The paragraphs can be separated  whith the same tags.
Headline tags <h> </h>, Headlines come in six different types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. These tags are used in headlines, and in sub headlines. The element which is h1 is the largest, and h6 is the smallest.
Bold tags <strong> </strong> and <b> </b>, These tags <strong> The tags make text to be bold, which is used to show importance, or urgency. Then there is <b> element which is normal and does not carry any specific meaning, it simply allows us to make something bold visually and does not imply any alternative voice or mood.
Italic tags <i> </i> and <em></em>, <em> represent emphasized text, typicallty displayed in italics. <i> displays in italic. These 2 tags may appear identical but carry different meaning.
List tags <li></li>, This is use to define a list within ordered that you may first use this element <ol> or unordered and you may also use this element <ol>.

HTML Quotess
<cite> , <q> and <blockquote> <cite> is used to reference the source of a quote. Om the otherside <blockquote> is used to indicate that the enclosed text that is no longer quotated from another source. <q> is also use dto define inline quotation. It indicates that the enlosed text ia a quaotation and browser may tipically shows it with quotation mark.

Date Elements
The <time> element in HTML helps us deal with dates and times. It lets us write dates in a way that is very easy for people to read on a websiutes, but it also has a special trick which is (datetime) attribute. This attribute uses a specific format like 2024-01-30 to tell computers the exact date.
For example, we might write "January 30th" between <time> tags, but behind the code we use the (datetime) attribute like this <time datetime="2024-01-30">January 30, 2024</time>. The computer understands this version.

HTML Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text
Superscript tags <sup> </sup>. are used for text that should be displayed above the normal text line, often for things like mathematical exponents.
Subscript tags <sub> </sub> are used for text that should be displayed below the normal text line, commonly used in chemical formulas or mathematical notation.
Small text tags <small> </small> tags are used to decrease the size of the text.
